Classifying Maternal Health Risk using Machine Learning.

Developed a Maternal Health Risk prediction model using various machine learning classifiers (e.g., Naive
Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine), and evaluated the performance based on their accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score.


Imported, cleaned, and engineered data from the UCI repository to predict which patients have a higher risk of
experiencing complications from pregnancy using regression models, achieving an accuracy of 87.49%.


Applied different feature selection techniques such as Forward Selection, Information Gain, and Correlation
Coefficient for assessing determinants of maternal health.
